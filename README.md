Formula 1 Moments iOS Application

As a big fan of Formula 1, I created an app to easily be able to see some of my favorite F1 moments with a click of a button!

This iOS app plays .mov or .mp4 with a click of a button.
Implented with an algorithm that does not allow the same consecutive video to be played and has a button to toggle volume on or off.

Some examples include:
